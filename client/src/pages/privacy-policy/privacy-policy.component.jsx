      Protecting Your Privacy
    </h3>
    <p>
      Imogene, LLC. (&quot;Imogene&quot; or &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;,
      or &quot;our&quot;)
      is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Statement
      (the &quot;Statement&quot;) applies to all of the channels in the United States by
      which Imogene collects, uses and/or shares your information, including
      online channels (e.g., Imogene U.S. websites, mobile applications, and
      social media pages, collectively referred to as the &quot;Website&quot;) and
      offline channels (e.g., in-store transactions and events in the U.S.).

      This Statement describes the information we collect in the United States
      and how we use and disclose it. Your continued use of the Website
      constitutes your consent to the terms of this Statement and any updates.
      This Statement is incorporated into, and is subject to, the Terms and
      Conditions. If you do not agree to the Terms and Conditions or this Statement,
      please do not use the Website.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What Information Do We Collect and Store?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Except as disclosed below, we don’t sell, trade, give away, or rent your
      personal information to any third party outside of Imogene. One of the basic
      principles we&apos;ve tried to follow is to limit the information we collect
      from and share about you.

      This section describes how we may collect information through both
      online and offline channels.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Personal Information
    </h3>
    <p>
      We collect and store personal information that you provide to us,
      including through the Website, at our stores and events, and in
      communications with our Customer Service Department. We combine
      the information we receive from or about you through any of these
      channels and use and disclose it in accordance with this Statement.

      In general, you can use and visit our Website without submitting
      any personal information; however, in order to utilize and access
      specific features, you will be asked to submit your personal information.
      Personal information means information that may be used to readily identify,
      contact, or locate an individual and may include, but is not limited to,
      your full name, birth date, email, physical address, telephone number,
      and gender. We may also infer your general location based on your
      device’s IP Address, which we use to personalize content provided
      to you on the Website and in emails we send to you.

      For example, when you open an account or place an order, we may
      collect and store some or all of the following information
      that you provide: your full name, billing address, shipping address,
      email address, and telephone number. When you choose to log-in and
      connect your social media account, such as Facebook, to your Website account,
      we collect public information about you from that social media website
      and non-public information (such as your email address) with your permission.
      We collect your email address and zip code if you subscribe to our newsletter,
      and we collect your mobile number if you send a text message to us to opt
      into receiving text messages from us.

      When you make payments through the Website, you will need to provide
      financial account information, such as your credit card number,
      to our third-party service providers. We do not collect or store such information,
      though we will receive information about completed transactions
      that does not include credit card numbers.

      In certain areas of the Website, you may be asked to provide personal
      information in connection with registration for community postings
      (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, employment applications,
      or customer service requests, among other reasons. When we run a contest
      or sweepstakes on or relating to our Website, it will be accompanied
      by a set of rules. The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify
      how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed,
      if it is different than as described in this Statement.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Non-Personal Usage Information
    </h3>
    <p>
      We may also gather certain non-personally identifiable information
      about your use of our Website (&quot;Usage Information&quot;). Generally,
      this information is collected through &quot;traffic data.&quot; We collect and
      store certain other information automatically whenever you interact
      with our Website. For example, we collect your IP address, browser
      information and reference site domain name every time you visit
      our Website. We also collect information regarding customer traffic
      patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and
      improve our Website, provide our customers with a fulfilling
      shopping experience, and personalize the Website, our communications
      with you, and your shopping experience.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How Do We Use Your Information?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We use information for internal and service-related purposes,
      including to provide and improve the Website and any of our products
      and services. For example, we may use your personal information to
      provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested,
      to process and ship orders, to provide customer service, to send
      you direct mail marketing communications (e.g., a catalog),
      to provide other services to you, and to personalize the Website,
      our communications with you, and your shopping experience.
      Your information also may be used to contact you about sales,
      new products and services (from us or others), new Website features,
      special offers, and personalized offers based on your address or
      general location based on your computer’s IP Address, unless you
      have opted to not receive promotional communications. We may also
      combine your offline purchase history data with personal information
      we collect online so that we may effectively market our products and
      services to you. Combining data allows Imogene to update and correct
      the information contained in our database and to provide you with
      product recommendations and special offers.

      We use non-personally identifiable Usage Information to help us
      determine how people use parts of the Website and who our visitors are.
      This allows us to improve our Website and ensure that it is as
      appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible.
      We may combine Usage Information about you with other information,
      including personal information, about you in order to personalize
      the Website and our communications with you and to provide you
      with information that may be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How Do We Share Your Information?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Except as described in this Statement, we will not disclose
      your personal information outside of Imogene without your consent.
      We may, however, share the personal information we collect
      about you in limited circumstances, including:

      <ul>
        <li>
          With third-party service providers. For example, we may share your
          information with third party service providers for purposes including,
          without limitation, payment and order processing; market research;
          fraud protection; data analysis; email management; and stocking and
          shipping services. These service providers have access to such personal
          information needed to perform their functions and are contractually
          obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information.
        </li>
        <li>
          With our parent company and affiliates. To provide and improve the Website,
          we may implement features together with our parent company and affiliates
          which permit their access to personal information about users for the
          purpose of implementing the features. For example, they have access
          to user account registration information so Website users can participate
          in a global account log-in feature.
        </li>
        <li>
          With other partners for their marketing purposes. In connection with the
          distribution of our marketing materials, we may rent, exchange, share
          with cooperative databases or other partners and/or cross-reference certain
          information, including customer names, mailing addresses and purchase
          history information, to our select partners that will enable them to
          contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.
          You may opt-out of having your personal information incorporated into
          these cooperative databases or shared with these other partners by clicking here.
        </li>
        <li>
          With law enforcement agencies, governmental officials or other third
          parties as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is
          necessary to protect our rights or property and/or comply with a
          judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served.
          If we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is
          necessary to protect the personal safety of Imogene employees,
          customers or the public, and to enforce our Privacy Statement and Terms of Use.
        </li>
        <li>
          With other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired
          by that business entity or in connection with a partial or total sale
          of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you otherwise consent or direct us to share your information with third parties.
        </li>
      </ul>

      What Steps Are Taken to Help Secure Personal Information?
    </h3>
    <p>
      An athlete can’t play without confidence, and you shouldn’t order from a company
      that doesn’t follow secure data practices. Our goal is to deliver performance
      to you in every way. That includes information security. We use reasonable
      security procedures to protect your information. However, no data transferred
      over the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot
      ensure or warrant the security of your information and you understand that
      any information that you transfer or transmit to us is done at your own risk.
      Personal information collected at our Website is stored in secure operating
      environments that are not available to the public. To protect the security
      of your information during transmission, we may use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
      software, which encrypts information you input. Most browsers will give a visual
      indication of when your connection is secure; for example, Internet Explorer
      will show a padlock icon in the lower right of the browser window.

      If you place an order through our Website, you may have the option to set up an
      account and provide an email address and password. In order to help protect
      your personal information, you should be careful about providing your password
      to others. If you wish to cancel your account, or if you become aware of any loss,
      theft or unauthorized use of your password, please contact Customer
      Service immediately. Please refer to the last section of this Statement
      (&quot;How to Contact Us&quot;) for contact information.
